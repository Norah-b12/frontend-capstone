# University Events Platform (UniEvent)

## Project Overview
UniEvent is a web application that allows users to **explore and follow universities across Saudi Arabia**, view upcoming events, and manage personal preferences such as favorites and followed universities. Users can **sign up, log in, and manage their profiles**, while university events are dynamically fetched and displayed.

The platform emphasizes **user engagement** through features like:

- Searching for universities  
- Viewing university-specific events  
- Favoriting events  

It also provides **account management** capabilities, including editing profiles and deleting accounts.
